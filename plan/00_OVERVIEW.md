### Session 2: Content Restructuring (2025-12-19)

**Phase 0: Conceptual Restructuring (T0.1) ✅**
- Restructured Introduction chapters from implementation-focused to concept-focused
- Updated intro.md with "Transport Layers" section (CAN vs WiFi/TCP rationale)
- Completely rewrote intro_async_blink.md → "Node Startup Sequence" with Mermaid diagram
- Completely rewrote intro_ab_events.md → "Events and Run Mode" with Mermaid diagram
- Added "Multi-Node Network Behavior" explanations
- Installed and configured mdbook-mermaid preprocessor
- Updated SUMMARY.md chapter titles for clarity
- Updated FORWARD_REFERENCES.md tracking

**Phase 1: Content Restructuring (T1.1-T1.4) ✅**
- **T1.1**: Archived Nucleo/STM32 content (openmrn.md → archive/openmrn-stm32.md)
- **T1.2**: Created ESP32 chapter skeleton (esp32-arduino.md with 8 sections)
- **T1.3**: Updated SUMMARY.md, verified book builds, configured Mermaid
- **T1.4**: Completely rewrote Getting Started chapter (start.md)
  - Archived old Nucleo content → archive/start-nucleo.md
  - New structure: What We're Building, Why WiFi/TCP, Platform Choice, Prerequisites, Dev Environment, JMRI Overview, What's Next

**Phase 2: Documentation & Setup (T2.0) ✅**
- **T2.0**: Wrote PlatformIO & OpenMRNLite Installation Guide
  - Documented VS Code + PlatformIO extension installation
  - Documented ESP32 board selection (DevKit recommendations)

## Key Decisions Locked In

✅ **Audience**: Embedded C++ developers wanting to build LCC boards  
✅ **v0.1 Focus**: ESP32 + Arduino + PlatformIO with WiFi/TCP transport  
✅ **Hardware**: Breadboard with button (input) + LED (output)  
✅ **Monitoring**: JMRI via TCP/GridConnect  
✅ **Diagrams**: Mermaid (VS Code + mdBook support)  
✅ **Timeline**: Multiple sessions + sub-agent research for specialized tasks  
✅ **Strategy**: Archive Nucleo/STM32 (v1), add later chapters for CAN + advanced  

---

## Next Session: Recommended Starting Point

**Phase 2 is ready to begin!** All conceptual restructuring and chapter skeletons are complete.

### Recommended Approach: Fill in ESP32 Chapter Content

**Tasks**: T2.1, T2.2, T2.3, T2.4 (~6.5-8 hours total, can be done across multiple sessions)

**T2.0 - Write PlatformIO & OpenMRNLite Installation Guide** ✅ COMPLETED
- Document VS Code + PlatformIO extension installation
- ESP32 board/platform selection and setup
- OpenMRNLite library installation (Library Manager only)
- Add to esp32-arduino.md sections 1-3
- **Result**: Readers can complete tool setup

**T2.1 - Create async_blink_esp32 Arduino Sketch** (2-3 hours)
- Write complete .ino sketch with WiFi, button input, LED output
- Use OpenMRNLite/examples/ESP32/ as reference (locally available)
- Include inline comments explaining startup and event handling
- Test on actual ESP32 hardware (if available)
- **Result**: Working example code ready to document

**T2.2 - Create PlatformIO Configuration** (1 hour)
- Write platformio.ini template for ESP32
- Document library installation options
- Add to esp32-arduino.md with installation steps
- **Result**: Readers can build the example immediately

**T2.3 - Document Hardware Setup** (1.5 hours)
- GPIO pin assignments, breadboard wiring diagram
- BOM (bill of materials)
- Create Mermaid or ASCII schematic
- Add to esp32-arduino.md
- **Result**: Complete hardware assembly guide

**T2.4 - Create JMRI Setup Guide** (1.5 hours)
- Detailed JMRI installation and configuration steps
- Expected startup messages and event traces
- Troubleshooting common connection issues
- Add to esp32-arduino.md
- **Result**: Verification and debugging support

### Alternative: Skip to Testing (if you have hardware)

If you have an ESP32 and want to jump straight to testing:
- **Phase 3 tasks** (T3.1-T3.4) let you build, test, and verify the system
- You'll need to reference async_blink example in openmrn/applications/async_blink/targets/esp32
- Useful for validation before writing documentation
