| Focus of this book | ✅ Updated | WiFi/TCP first, CAN later approach |
| Node Concept | ✅ Complete | Nodes as building blocks, 6-byte unique IDs |
| **Transport Layers** | ✅ Added | CAN vs WiFi/TCP rationale; WiFi first in v0.1 |
| **Node Startup Sequence** | ✅ Restructured | WHAT happens (CID → RID → AMD → Init Complete) with Mermaid diagram |
| **Multi-Node Participation** | ✅ Added | Other nodes listen/respond during startup |
| **Events and Run Mode** | ✅ Restructured | Producer/consumer model with Mermaid event flow diagram |
| **Standards References** | ✅ Complete | Links to S-9.7.x.x documents |

## Writing Principles for v0.1

1. **Simplicity First**: Explain WiFi/TCP as intentional stepping stone to CAN; don't try to explain both
2. **Hands-On**: Every section should have concrete steps or code
3. **Working Example**: async_blink_esp32 should be fully buildable and runnable
4. **Diagrams Aid Learning**: Use Mermaid to visualize abstract concepts (startup sequence, event flow)
5. **Verify Early**: Troubleshooting section helps readers confirm success quickly
6. **Link to Standards**: Reference markdown/standards/ for deep dives without overwhelming v0.1
