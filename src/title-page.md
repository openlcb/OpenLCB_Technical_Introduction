# OpenLCB Programmer's Guide

_by John Socha‑Leialoha_

This edition is current as of 2025-12-23.

I wrote this book to help developers get started with OpenLCB. I used GitHub Copilot to help draft the text; during writing Copilot was provided access to the OpenMRN and OpenMRN‑Lite source code, the NMRA LCC standards, and NMRA LCC technical notes to assist with examples and explanations.

The source for this book is available at the project's GitHub repository: [openlcb/OpenLCB_Technical_Introduction](https://github.com/openlcb/OpenLCB_Technical_Introduction).

Feedback and contributions are welcome — please open an issue or submit a pull request on the repository's issues page: [openlcb/OpenLCB_Technical_Introduction issues](https://github.com/openlcb/OpenLCB_Technical_Introduction/issues).
