# Node

A _Node_ is the basic building block of an OpenLCB network. It's a device that can send and receive OpenLCB messages. We'll describe these messages in more detail in a later chapter.

Each node has a unique 6-byte ID that must be assigned by the manufacturer. We'll describe in a later chapter how you can get your own set of IDs to use in your products (or DIY boards).
